I am a researcher at [Peking University - GALBOT Joint Lab](https://www.galbot.com/)
and [Center on Frontiers of Computing Studies (CFCS)](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/), directed
by [He Wang](https://hughw19.github.io/) and [Li Yi](https://ericyi.github.io/). I received my B.S. from UC Santa Cruz
in 2023. I have previously interned at BAAI, SenseTime, Westlake University, and Tsinghua University, and have also
participated in exchange programs at UC Berkeley and Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

Currently, my research focuses on combining Reinforcement Learning (RL)—a reward-driven trial-and-error learning
approach—with Model Predictive Control (MPC)—a model-based real-time optimization method—to develop more robust and
efficient control systems. Feel free to reach out if you're interested in my work!
